Here are the components you should aim to cover in your **paper**:

* Problem statement and hypothesis
* Description of your data set and how it was obtained
* Description of any pre-processing steps you took
* What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
* How you chose which features to use in your analysis
* Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them
* Your challenges and successes
* Possible extensions or business applications of your project
* Conclusions and key learnings

Your **presentation** should cover these components with less breadth and less depth. Focus on creating an engaging, clear, and informative presentation that tells the story of your project.

You should create a GitHub repository for your project that contains the following:

* **Project paper:** any format (PDF, Markdown, etc.)
* **Presentation slides:** any format (PDF, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.)
* **Code:** commented Python scripts, and any other code you used in the project
* **Data:** data files in "raw" or "processed" format
* **Data dictionary (aka "code book"):** description of each variable, including units
